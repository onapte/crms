# Criminal Record Management System

## Abstract
Crime is an act against the law and is a threat to the comfort and safety of the inhabitants and so, requires efficient and effective monitoring. For the reason of efficient and effective monitoring of crime, Criminal Record Management System have been developed and used all over the world. The Criminal Record Management System is used to store information related to the criminals, crimes committed by criminals, complaint records, case history etc. But the existing system has many flaws and requires additional manpower to function to its full extent. So, we have proposed a Criminal Record Management System which aims to eliminate almost all the existing system flaws. The proposed system consists of login module, category module, crime module, criminal module, court module, police module, prison module. The main aim of the web system is to file/manage complaints/criminal records online without coming to police station. The system is designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for graphical user interface and PHP, SQL for database management. 

## Introduction
The goal of the Online Criminal Record Management System is to replace the current manual system using computerized tools and full-fledged computer applications, meeting the needs of all police officers so that their important data/information can be processed for a longer period of time while still being easily accessible. The required applications and hardware are readily accessible  and  simple  to  use.  This  system  also  keeps  computerized  logs  of  all  the  criminal complaints  filed.  The  key  goal  of  this  initiative  is  to  warn  any  police  officer  in  the  country about every criminal's release, including the criminal's id, name, and form of crime. It could be used  by  the  police  department  to  keep  track  of  the  various  events  relevant  to  the  First Information  Report.  Many  of  these  operations  (such  as  complaint  filing  and  information updating) are handled in this framework, which saves time. This application is for the police stations that provide facilities for reporting crimes, filing FIR and maintaining prisoner records. It  provides  better  prospective  for  the  enhancement  of  organization  regarding  quality  and transparency.

## Conclusion & Future Scope
This project was done on a small scale with minimal user interfacewhich can be improved. The project can be improved with better Front-end user interface and division of access plus adding more functionality using JavaScript. Features like Search barcan be added to view data in a compact way instead of viewing all data.
