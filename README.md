# Criminal Record Management System

The goal of the Online Criminal Record Management System is to replace the current manual system of handling criminal data using computerized tools and full-fledged computer applications, meeting the needs of all police officers so that important data can be stored for a longer period of time while still being easily accessible. The required applications and hardware are readily accessible and simple to  use. This  system  also  keeps  computerized logs of all the criminal complaints filed. The key goal of this initiative is to warn  any police  department in  the  country about any criminal's whereabouts, including the criminal's id, name, and form of crime. It could be used by police departments to keep track of various events relevant to the First Information Report (FIR). Many of these operations (such as complaint filing and information updating) are handled in this framework, which contributes to saving time. This application is for the police stations that provide facilities for reporting crimes, filing FIR and maintaining prisoner records. It provides better prospective for the enhancement of the organization in terms of quality and transparency.
